My inital impression is that Java is much more strict than Python, for example, requiring a semicolon to be added at the end of each line. Also, more words are required to yield the same result (e.g. "==" in Python is ".equals()" in Java). Despite differences in Python and Java, the main ideas are the same. Each has for and while loops, lists of one form or another, variables, etc. Also, when programming in any language, it can be very helpful to organize your tasks into more managable steps. I found looking through the online textbook to be helpful for understanding syntax and variable types (e.g. arrays). Also, when I was writing, it helped me to think about what I needed to do first, implement that, then add on to what I wrote. I started with an array of canned responses and a scanner to collect user input, and got those working before even thinking about mirror replacements. Also, sometimes it can be helpful to remember that just because something is working doesn't mean you can't change it if you have a better idea.
